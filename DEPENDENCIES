CAGEd-oPOSSUM Dependencies
==========================

If you wish to install your own *local* copy of the CAGEd-oPOSSUM software,
the following software modules and databases are required. NOTE: this
is *only required* if you wish to install a *local* copy of CAGEd-oPOSSUM.
It is *not* required to run CAGEd-oPOSSUM analysis on our web server.

Depending on whether you want to do a full install of CAGEd-oPOSSUM (which
includes the web inteface and local copies of the various databases etc.) or
you just want to run the main analysis script and connect to our databases,
not all of the the following are absolutely required. Where possible the
optional requirement of a package will be noted.


Requirements
------------
1) Perl version 5.10 or greater. If you are not planning to use JASPAR profiles
   then it may be possible to use a perl version < 5.10. The TFBS perl modules
   required to access the JASPAR database utilizes the smartmatch operator
   which was not introduced until perl v.5.10.

2) Perl modules

   The folowing perl modules are generally required to be installed.
   Some of these may not be absolutely required, depending on the type of
   installation and what features of the software are used, but it is "safer"
   to intall everything and they should all be fairly easy to install through
   CPAN:

   	Array::Utils
	CGI
   	CGI::Application
	Data::Dumper
	DBI
	DBD::mysql
	File::Temp
	Log::Log4perl
	Log::Dispatch::File
	PDL (required by TFBS perl modules)
	Persistence::Object::Simple
	Readonly
	Statistics::Distributions
	Statistics::R
	Template

3) The BioPerl library. Versions 1.4 and 1.6 should both work.
   CAGEd-oPOSSUM has *not* been tested with BioPerl versions >= 2 but may
   work.

   The BioPerl library available at:
   	http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Getting_BioPerl

   It is also available through CPAN which is probably the easiest way to
   install it.

4) BedTools is required. CAGEd-oPOSSUM has been developed with v2.21.0. Older
   versions may not work as some of the option parameters have changed over
   time. Newer versions may work if the functionalities utilized by
   CAGEd-oPOSSUM haven't changed.

5) The TFBS perl modules are required.

   This is available at as a tarball at:
   	http://tfbs.genereg.net/

   The easiest way then is to download the tarball, uncompress it and then:
       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make install (as root)

   NOTE: the TFBS modules themselves have a couple of dependencies.
         PDL is unconditionally required as noted above. GD is optional.

6) The JASPAR DB of transcription factor binding site profiles is required.

   If you plan to run *a lot* of CAGEd-oPOSSUM analyses, please install your
   own local copy of this database!
   
   Please see the see the "Accessing / Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases"
   in the main INSTALL file for more information on accessing or downloading
   your own copy of the JASPAR DB.

7) Unless you will only run CAGEd-oPOSSUM with your own user-defined CAGE peaks
   and/or your own TFBS profiles matrices, the CAGEd-oPOSSUM databases of
   pre-computed JASPAR TFBS profile binding sites are required. There are two
   databases, one for human and one for mouse.

   Again, if you plan to run a lot of CAGEd-oPOSSUM analyses, please install
   your own local copy of these databases!
   
   Please see the see the "Accessing / Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases"
   in the main INSTALL file for more information on accessing or downloading
   your own copies of the CAGEd-oPOSSUM DBs.

8) The R statistics package is required to compute the Fisher scores as well
   as to generate the Z-score and Fisher score vs. GC composition plots.
   R is available at http://www.r-project.org

9) The HOMER package is required if you wish to include the HOMER TFBS
   over-representation analysis or if you just want to use randomly generated
   backgrounds of %GC composition and length matched sequences.

   HOMER is available at http://homer.salk.edu/homer

10) The web code utilizes jQuery and the jsTree jQuery plugin. This is *only*
   required if installing the full web interface. These are utilized to
   implement the dynamic FANTOM5 ontology search tree. The versions used
   in CAGEd-oPOSSUM are:
   
   	jQuery 1.11.3
	jsTree 3.1.1

    CAGEd-oPOSSUM also uses the sorttable.js javascript library. This is only
    used to make the HTML results table columns sortable.

    These have already been included within the CAGEd-oPOSSUM download.
