  <h1>CAGEd-oPOSSUM Download</h1>
  <p>
  You may download and install your own local copy of CAGEd-oPOSSUM.<br>
  Please see the <samp>INSTALL</samp> file included in the top-level of the CAGEd-oPOSSUM source code for details on how to perform a local installation.
  </p>

  <h2>Web Download</h2>
  <p>
    Download the full CAGEd-oPOSSUM source code including the API, stand-alone analysis scripts and web code directly from the web page here: <a href="download/CAGEd_oPOSSUM.tar.gz">CAGEd_oPOSSUM.tar.gz</a>
  </p>

  <h2>GitHub</h2>
  <p>
    The CAGEd-oPOSSUM source code is also available as a public repository on GitHub at: <a href="https://github.com/wassermanlab/CAGEd-oPOSSUM" target=_blank>https://github.com/wassermanlab/CAGEd-oPOSSUM</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Databases</h2>
  <p>
    There are two CAGEd-oPOSSUM databases of pre-computed transcription factor binding sites, one for each species:<br><br>
    <b>CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human</b><br>
    <b>CAGEd_oPOSSUM_mouse</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    As well there is our local copy of the JASPAR database of transcription factor binding site profiles:<br><br>
    <b>JASPAR_2016</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>By far the preferred</em> way to download these databases is via our <a href="ftp://www.cisreg.ca/pub/">FTP site</a> as CAGEd-oPOSSUM human and mouse databases are quite large (tens of Gigabytes).
  </p>

  <p>
    The two CAGEd-oPOSSUM species database are located in the <code>CAGEd_oPOSSUM/databases</code> sub-directory and the JASPAR database is located in the <code>JASPAR_2016</code> sub-directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the JASPAR database is quite small you may also download it directly from the database server using the mysldump facility.
    <br>
    <em>NOTE</em>: It is necessary to use the <samp>--skip-lock-tables</samp> option when using mysqldump.

  <p>
    The JASPAR_2016 database is hosted on our <samp>vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca</samp> server and may be downloaded using the MySQL user <samp>jaspar_r</samp>:
    <br>
    <pre><kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ mysqldump -h vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca -u jaspar_r --skip-lock-tables JASPAR_2016 &gt; JASPAR_2016.sql</kbd></pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    As the CAGEd-oPOSSUM human and mouse databases are quite large <em>please download them from our</em> <a href="ftp://www.cisreg.ca/pub/CAGEd_oPOSSUM/databases">FTP server</a>. If for some reason you are unable to download them via FTP please email us a 'opossum AT cmmt DOT ubc DOT ca' and we will try to rectify the problem or grant you permission to directly mysqldump them from our servers.
