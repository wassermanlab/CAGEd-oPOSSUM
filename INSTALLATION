CAGEd-oPOSSUM Installation
==========================

This file contains instructions for installing your own local copy of
CAGEd-oPOSSUM. This is not necessary if you just want to use the CAGEd-oPOSSUM
web-based tool at http://cagedop.cmmt.ubc.ca/CAGEd_oPOSSUM.

CAGEd-oPOSSUM was developed and tested in a Linux environment, specifically
CentOS and Ubuntu. We do not provide any instructions or support if you wish
to install it under Mac OS or Windows.

Please see the DEPENDENCIES file for a list of the prerequisite software
libraries, programs and databases that are required by CAGEd-oPOSSUM.

The steps listed below depend on the type of installation that is required,
i.e. whether you are just planning to run a stand-alone analysis by connecting
to the Wasserman lab databases, or wether you want to do a full install
including the web interface and local copies of the databases, or something
in between.

1) The code is available on GitHub at:

        https://github.com/wassermanlab/CAGEd-oPOSSUM

   It is also available for download as a compressed tar file by going to the
   Download page on the CAGEd-oPOSSUM website at:
   
        http://cagedop.cmmt.ubc.ca/CAGEd_oPOSSUM/download.html

   Download the code from GitHub or the CAGEd-oPOSSUM website and uncompress
   it as necessary into the local directory you want to use,

   e.g. /apps/CAGEd_oPOSSUM.
   
   This directory will be referred to as $COHOME.

   If you just want to run the stand-alone analysis script, it is located
   in:

        $COHOME/scripts/integrated_ssa.pl

   NOTE that CAGEd-oPOSSUM needs perl version of at least 5.10. In our local
   installation this required specifying a newer perl version to override
   our default installed version which was too old. You will need to change
   directive on the first line of the script:

        #!/usr/bin/env perl5.14
   
   As long as your default perl version is >= 5.10 you can just change this to:

        #!/usr/bin/env perl

   Otherwise you will need to specifiy an alternate newer installed version of
   perl.

   You will also probably need to change some settings in the options file:

        $COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/BaseOpt.pm

   Please see the "Configuring CAGEd-oPOSSUM Option Files" section below.

   If you are only planning to do a few analyses at a time, it is acceptable
   to use this script "as is" and have it retrieve necessary data from
   the Wasserman lab databases. However, if you plan to run a lot of analyses
   *PLEASE download and install* your own local copies of the various
   databases used by CAGEd-oPOSSUM. See the "Accessing / Downloading Wasserman
   Lab Databases" section further down. You may also need to do this if
   you find you are haveing any connection issues to our databases from your
   locale.

   The script itself has *many* options. The script contains internal
   documentation describing these in a fair amount of detail.

   A typical usage of the script would be:

        $COHOME/scripts/integrated_ssa.pl -j COPJOB1 -m <my_email>@<my_domain> -s human -dir $COHOME/analysis/results/COPJOB1 -plot -txids FF:11881-125C9,FF:11871-125B8,FF:11861-125A7 -trex 1 -tto -brand -co CORE -tax vertebrates -ic 8 -up 500 -dn 500 -th 0.85 -n All -hma -sr fisher_p_value

   where the options indicate:
        -j = Assign the job ID COPJOB1 to this job. Used for identifying the
             job. This appears in the summary section of the HTML results page
             and also within the email notification messages.

        -m = Your email address. Sends an email to you notifying when the job
             is complete. Generally used for web-based CAGEd-oPOSSUM.

        -s = The species name, either 'human' or 'mouse'. Required when running
             CAGEd-oPOSSUM with the pre-computed binding sites retrieved from
             the CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human or CAGEd_oPOSSUM_mouse database.

        -dir = The directory where the analysis results files will be written.
               If it does not already exist the script will attempt to create
               it. NOTE that is only creates the lowest level directory so the
               parent path must exist.

        -plot = Create the Z-score and Fisher score vs. %GC composition plots.
                These plots display the distribution of scores for the
                transcription factors binding site motifs. Motifs whose scores
                fall above the default threshold are labelled. This helps in
                visually determining significance. These plots are also very
                useful in alerting you to any %GC composition biases that may
                have affected the analysis by observing any skew in the plots.

        -txids = There are several different methods of specifying the CAGE
                 peaks to be used in the foreground. This specific option
                 is used to to supply a comma-separated list of FANTOM5 sample
                 IDs.

        -trex = Specifies that CAGE peaks with at least this relative
                expression level for any of the FANTOM5 samples provided with
                the -txids option be used to define the CAGE peak TFBS search
                regions used in the analysis.

        -tto = Filter CAGE peaks so that only CAGE peaks flagged as TSSs by
               the FANTOM5 peak classifier be included in the analysis.

        -brand = Generate a random background set of genomic regions to closely
                 match the %GC composition and length distribution of the
                 foreground CAGE peak regions being analyzed. Uses the HOMER
                 software to accomplish this.

        -co = Specify which JASPAR collection to use. The database of
              pre-computed binding sites is created using the JASPAR CORE
              collection. The default is "CORE".

        -tax = Only applies if the collection used is JASPAR CORE. Specify
               which JASPAR CORE collection taxonomic supergroups to use.
               One or more tax groups may be specified as a comma-separated
               list.

        -ic = Only use TFBS profiles with at least this level of information
              content (specificity).

        -up = Apply this amount of upstream flanking sequence to the CAGE peaks
              when computing the regions to search for TFBS.

        -dn = Apply this amount of downstream flanking sequence to the CAGE
              peaks when computing the regions to search for TFBS.

        -th = TFBS score threshold. Report TFBS positions which have at least
              this relative matrix score.

        -n = Only the top N scoring motifs are reported in the results based
             on the selected score sort order as specified by the -sr option.
             The default is 'All'. There is not real advantage in setting this
             to anything else than 'All'.

        -hma = If specified also run the HOMER motif analysis on the CAGE peak
               regions.

        -sr = Specifies whether to sort the results from high to low by either
              the Fisher or Z-score. The default is to sort by the Fisher
              score.

2) Install the HOMER software. This is required if you wish to use
   the %GC composition and length matched random background option or if
   you want to also run the HOMER motif analysis.

   The HOMER software is available at: http://homer.salk.edu/homer.

   From here on, this document will assume you have installed HOMER under
   /apps/Homer.

   NOTE that HOMER itself has several dependencies such as weblogo and
   ghostscript which you will also need to install.

3) Install the CAGEd-oPOSSUM databases. This is only necessary if you are
   planning to do a lot of analyses. For light use, you may just connect
   to the Wasserman lab databases. Please see the Accessing / Downloading
   Wasserman Lab Databases section below for details on these two options.

The rest of the installation steps below are generally only required if you
plan to install your own local copy of the CAGEd-oPOSSUM webtool. You will
also need to edit the CAGEd-oPOSSUM option files. See the
"Configuring CAGEd-oPOSSUM Option Files" section below.

4) If you wish to set up your own local CAGEd-oPOSSUM web-based tool, you
   need to set up symbolic links from your webserver htdocs and
   cgi-bin directories. For example if you have installed CAGEd-oPOSSUM in 
   $COHOME/apps/CAGEd_oPOSSUM then assuming you are using the Apache server
   installed in /var/www you would use something like the following:

        $ ln -s $COHOME/cgi-bin /var/www/cgi-bin/CAGEd_oPOSSUM
        $ ln -s $COHOME/htdocs /var/www/htdocs/CAGEd_oPOSSUM

   You may have to edit your apache config file (httpd.conf) to allow following
   of symbolic links and executing cgi-bin files, e.g.:
    <Directory "/usr/local/apache/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride FileInfo
        Options FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI +Includes
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    You then need to edit the CAGEd-oPOSSUM option files. See the 
    "Configuring CAGEd-oPOSSUM Option Files" section below.

5) Create the following directories (if they have not already been
   automatically created when you downloaded and uncompressed the CAGEd-oPOSSUM
   source code or fetched it from GitHub):

        $COHOME/tmp
        $COHOME/htdocs/results
        $COHOME/logs

   Change the ownership of these directories to that of the user under which the
   web server runs (usually 'nobody' or 'apache') and/or make these directories
   at least read/write/executable to to that user, e.g:

       chown apache:apache htdocs/tmp
       chmod 700 htdocs/tmp

6) Edit the $COHOME/htdocs/index.html file and change specific URL to refer
   to the webserver CAGEd-oPOSSUM is residing on.

7) Edit the htdocs/templates/master.html file and change specific URLs to
   refer to the webserver CAGEd-oPOSSUM is residing on.


Configuring CAGEd-oPOSSUM Options Files
=======================================

There are two main options files which need to be configured to reflect your
own local setup:

   $COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Opt/BaseOpt.pm
   $COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/BaseOpt.pm

There intention of having two different options files was to logically separate
options specific to the CAGEd-oPOSSUM web-tool vs. general options but due to
the way in which the CAGEd-oPOSSUM software evolved, the current distribution
of the various options between these two files is admittedly not entirely
logical.

A third options file, $COPHOMT/lib/OPOSSUM/Opt/ExperimentOpt.pm contains
default parameters settting and generally does not need to be changed.

Particularly you will need to edit some paths to reflect your local setup.
Some of the settings are only used when CAGEd-oPOSSUM is run as a web tool.

Edit the configuration constants in the main options file
$COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/BaseOpt.pm to reflect your specific
installation.

   * Edit the CAGEd-oPOSSUM DB connection constants, OPOSSUM_DB_HOST etc.

For web-based CAGEd-oPOSSUM, edit the configuration constants in the main
web options file $COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/BaseOpt.pm to reflect your
specific installation.

   Specifically,
   
   * Edit the OPOSSUM_HOME constant to point to the top-level directory
     under which CAGEd-oPOSSUM is installed. This should be the directory
     referred to earlier in this document as $COHOME.
   
   * Edit the WEB_SERVER_URL constant to point to the top-level URL of your
     CAGEd-oPOSSUM web server.
   
   * Edit the WEB_SERVER_HOME constant to point to the top-level directory
     of your apache web server.
   
   * Edit the JASPAR DB connection constants, JASPAR_DB_HOST etc. depending
     on whether you are connecting to the Wasserman lab's JASPAR database
     or you have installed your own local copy of the database.

It is also possible to edit other values in these files to reflect
different default values for the CAGEd-oPOSSUM analysis.


Accessing / Downloading Wasserman Lab Databases
===============================================

If you only plan to run a few analyses, then you may connect directly to the
databases hosted by Wasserman lab servers. However if you plan to do many
analyses, especially if you are planning to run multiple simultaneous analysis,
*PLEASE download and install* your own local copy of these databases. These
two options are described in the relevant sections below.

Accessing the Wasserman Lab Databases Directly
----------------------------------------------
You may connect directly to the CAGEd-oPOSSUM related databases hosted on the
Wasserman lab servers. Each of these databases have a dedicated "read-only"
(i.e. select privileges only) user associated with them. This user does not
require a password.

The table below gives the CAGEd-oPOSSUM database names, the servers they are
hosted on, and the associated "read-only" user:

Database name           DB server host         User
--------------------    -------------------    ---------
JASPAR_2016             vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca        jaspar_r
CAGEd-oPOSSUM_human     cagedop.cmmt.ubc.ca    cagedop_r
CAGEd-oPOSSUM_mouse     cagedop.cmmt.ubc.ca    cagedop_r

These connection parameters are set in CAGEd-oPOSSUM options files. To connect
to the Wasserman lab databases, you do not need to change these. If you install local copies of these databases, you will need to modify these parameters. This
is described in the local installation section below.


Downloading and Installing Your Own Copies of the CAGEd-oPOSSUM Databases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must have a local MySQL server set up. Setting up MySQL is beyond the
scope of this document. Please see the MySQL documentation at
http://dev.mysql.com/doc.

To obtain copies of the databases required for CAGEd-oPOSSUM, please use the
Wasserman lab anonymous FTP site, cisreg.ca.

The JASPAR database, "JASPAR_2016" is available for FTP download under:
    pub/JASPAR/JASPAR_2016.sql.tar.gz

As the JASPAR database is relatively small, it is also be possible to obtain
it by downloading it directly from our server with the mysqldump utility using
the connection parameters as described in the table above.

Note: you will need to use the --skip-lock-tables option to the mysqldump
command, e.g.:

    mysqldump -h vm5.cmmt.ubc.ca -u jaspar_r JASPAR_2016 --skip-lock-tables > JASPAR_2016.sql

There are two CAGEd-oPOSSUM databases of pre-computed transcription factor
binding sites based on the JASPAR 2016 profiles, one for human and one for
mouse:

    CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human
    CAGEd_oPOSSUM_mouse

Thes are also available for FTP download under:
    pub/CAGEd_oPOSSUM/databases/

*PLEASE DO NOT* use mysqldump to retrieve the CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human and
CAGEd_oPOSSUM_mouse databases from our server as they are quite large,
118GB and 73GB, for human and mouse respectively. If you are having trouble
downloading them from our FTP site, please contact us at opossum AT cmmt DOT ubc DOT ca.

After you have downloaded and uncompressed each of the databases, create
the databases in mysql:

    mysql> create database CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human;
    mysql> create database CAGEd_oPOSSUM_mouse;

Load the downloaded database SQL files into your local MySQL installation, e.g.  from the command line:

    $ mysql -u root -p CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human < CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human.sql

Enter the MySQL root password when prompted. Note, if you didn't set a MySQL
root password, leave out the -p switch in the command above. Run this for
each of the species databases you plan to use and the JASPAR database.

After you load the databases into your local MySQL database server, you need
to create mysql users, 'jaspar_r' and 'cagedop_r' which have select-only
privileges and don't require a password, e.g.:

    mysql> grant select on JASPAR_2016.* to jaspar_r@'%';
    mysql> grant select on CAGEd_oPOSSUM_human.* to cagedop_r@'%';
    mysql> grant select on CAGEd_oPOSSUM_mouse.* to cagedop_r@'%';

Of course you can configure your local copies differently.

You then need to edit to database configuration files to reflect your
local installation parameters. NOTE that there are two different configuration
files, one for JASPAR and one for the CAGEd-oPOSUM human and mouse databases: 

The JASPAR database settings are located under the "JASPAR DB Access" section
in the file: 

    $COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Web/Opt/BaseOpt.pm.

The CAGEd_oPOSUM_human and CAGEd_oPOSUM_mouse database settings are located
under the "CAGEd-oPOSSUM DB Access" settings in the file:

    $COHOME/lib/OPOSSUM/Opt/BaseOpt.pm.
