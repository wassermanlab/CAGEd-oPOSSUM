The CAGEd-oPOSSUM web application has been developed by David J. Arenillas with
project supervision from Anthony Mathelier and Wyeth W. Wasserman.

Much of the code used in CAGEd-oPOSSUM has been adapted and modified from code
originally developed for the oPOSSUM web tool also developed in the Wasserman
Lab with contributions from various lab members over the years.
